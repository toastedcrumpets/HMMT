			    <li>
				Engineering is the translation of the
				real world into mathematics.</li>
			    <li>
				This has to be done to gain certainty
				about design, anything else is
				guesswork.</li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				We do this informally all the time:
				<ul>
				    <li>
					<b>Q:</b> How long will it take to drive to
					Edinburgh which is 128 miles away?					
				    </li>
				    <li class="fragment"><b>A:</b> Assuming
					we drive at $60~\text{MPH}$, it
					will take
					$S/V=128/60\approx2~\text{h}$.</li>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				The essence of good engineering is
				choosing the right approximations,
				making sure you overdesign and not
				underdesign (i.e., don't choose
				$70~\text{MPH}$, low-ball your
				velocity estimate to make sure you're
				early).</li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				Design is never-ending, you can always
				improve it (i.e., account for
				traffic, weather, etc.)</li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				You will need experience to help you
				decide what are acceptable
				approximations.</li>
			    <li class="fragment">
			      Many models/approximations start off
				algebraic like above but as you add
				complexity they become
				differential. This course gives you
				experience in solving differential
				types of systems.
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </section>
		    <section>
			<ul>
			    <li><b>Q:</b> A skydiver has lept from a
				plane, what is their terminal velocity and
				how do they approach it?</li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				Assume from experience that drag
				forces are of the form
				$F^{drag}=k\,v^2$ where $k$ is a
				drag coefficient.
			    </li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				We already know from experience that Newton's law applies,
				\begin{align*}
				F = m\,a = m\frac{{\rm d} v}{{\rm d} t} = F^{gravity}+F^{drag}\\
				\frac{1}{g+\frac{k}{m}\,v^2}\frac{{\rm d} v}{{\rm d} t} = 1\\
				v = \sqrt{g\,m\,k^{-1}}\tanh\left(t\sqrt{g\,k\,m^{-1}}\right)=\sqrt{g\,m\,k^{-1}}\frac{1-e^{-2\,t\sqrt{g\,k\,m^{-1}}}}{1+e^{-2\,t\sqrt{g\,k\,m^{-1}}}}
				\end{align*}
			    </li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				Differential equations are required
				here (and in most engineering
				problems) and they will test your math
				knowledge!</li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				In this course, the problems are
				selected to test only a limited (but
				non-trivial) range of mathematics. You
				will need to practice the covered
				maths, and future courses will expand
				on this!</li>

				A large part of this course will be
				setting up the differential equations.</li>
			    <li class="fragment">
				There are too many systems out there
				to cover this in general, so why <b>Heat</b>, <b> Mass</b>, and
				<b> Momentum</b> in particular?
				<ul>
				    <li class="fragment">
					They have very similar properties,
					they all <b>flow</b> and <b>conduct</b>/<b>diffuse</b>.
				    </li>
				    <li class="fragment">
					This is because they are the <b>conserved
					quantities</b> of a system.<br/>They
					do not rapidly change or fluctuate

					concentration to low
					concentration.</li>

					Almost every engineering

				    </li>
				    <li class="fragment">
					These systems may utilise <b>one</b> or <b> all</b> of
					these modes of transport to achieve a
					desired effect.

				    <li class="fragment">
					For example, nuclear reactors need

			<ul>
			    <li>
				You should already be familiar of some of the simple ways
				in which we can treat transport phenomena from your earlier
				courses.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				For conduction of heat, we use the
				integral form of Fourier's law.
				\begin{align*} Q &= U\,A\,\Delta
				T\end{align*}
			    </li>
			    <li>
				The problem with this expression is its only valid for
				very simple systems (like a flat wall).
			    </li>
			    <li>
				However, as its name suggests, it is the integrated form of
				<b> differential form of Fourier's law</b>.
				\begin{align*} q &= -k\frac{dT}{dx}\end{align*}
			    </li>
			    <li>
				We should be able to take the more general differential
				form and apply it to any heat transfer problem...
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </section>
		    <section>
			<ul>
			    <li>   We also need to approach heat transfer problems through
				Energy balances.
				\begin{align*} (Q_{in} - Q_{out})\Delta t &= m\,C_P\Delta T\end{align*}
			    </li>
			    <li>   Again, this is just an integrated form of a <b>
				differential energy balance</b>:
				\begin{align*} q_{in} - q_{out} &= \rho\,C_P \frac{dT}{dt}\end{align*}
			    </li>
			    <b> Transport phenomena</b> is the study of using <i>differential</i> constitutive relationships (e.g., Fourier's law))
			    and <i>differential</i> balances to generate engineering
			    expressions for any system.
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </section>
		    <section>
			<ul>
			    <li>
				It's important to note that <b>transport
				phenomena</b> is
				more general than heat transfer.
			    </li>
			    <li>   You should be familiar with the transport equations of
				basic fluid flow.
			    </li>
			    <li>   For example, Bernoulli's equation is an energy balance of
				a flow:
				\begin{align*}\frac{1}{2}\rho\,v^2 + p - \rho\,g\,h\end{align*}
				\begin{align*}E_{kinetic} + E_{pressure} + E_\text{grav. potential}\end{align*}
			    </li>
			    <li>   And there is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for flow in a
				pipe, relating the volumetric flow-rate, $\dot{V}$, to the
				pressure drop, $\Delta p$.
				\begin{align*}
				\dot{V}_z= -\pi\frac{\Delta p}{L}\frac{R^4}{8\,\mu}
				\end{align*}
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </section>
		    <section>
			<ul>
			    <li>   Later in the course, we will show that Bernoulli's
				equation can be derived from a more general momentum balance
				equation:
				\begin{align*}
				\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{v}}{\partial t} &= -\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla \boldsymbol{v}
				+ \rho^{-1}\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau} - \rho^{-1}\nabla p + \boldsymbol{g}
				\end{align*}
			    </li>
			    <li>   If we then use a <i>constitutive relation</i> for momentum, such as Newton's law of
				viscosity:
				
				\begin{align*}
				\tau_{xy} = -\mu \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial y}
				\end{align*}
				we can then derive the Hagen-Poiseuille expression for flow in
				pipes.
			    </li>
			    <li>   Again, we can combine a constitutive relationship
				(Newton's law of viscosity) with a differential balance (momentum
				balance) to solve flow problems using the study of <b>Transport
				Phenomena</b>.
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </section>
		    <section>
			<p>
			  Analytical results of <b> Transport
			    Phenomena</b> are usually limited to
			    simple geometries and problems:

			    <li>
				Boiling liquids are an example of a complex heat
				transfer and multiphase flow problems:
				
				<img src="img/boiling.jpg" style="width:40%;margin:auto;display:block"></img>
				
			    </li
			    <li>
				We will need <b> empirical expressions</b>
				to be able to perform engineering
				calculations on this system.</li>
			    <li>   However, the best empirical
				expressions are usually based somehow
				on the simpler analytical results.</li>
			    <li>   In this course we will look at both
				analytical results from Transport
				Phenomena, and empirical
				&ldquo;fudges&rdquo; for more complex
				systems.</li>
