            <h2>Who am I? Am I an engineer?</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a Chemical Engineer by training, but I started out in my PhD as a scientist. I started my research
              career writing some modelling software (<a href="https://dynamomd.com">DynamOMD.com</a>). I was
              &ldquo;only&rdquo; a scientist as these simulations were not
              directly a real object, but some test of the theories of them (think ideal gas theory and beyond).

              <li>
                Then, while working in Germany in my post-doc, I had to simulate real
                <b>granular-dampers</b>, and even got to run experiments in
                <em>micro</em>-gravity (2009-2011).

                I then started running some of the largest
                &ldquo;experiments&rdquo; possible: designing and running
                pilot-scale trials producing $\approx 1$ tonne of novel
                sulfur-based cement as part of the Green Concrete Project
                (£3.3M, GORD, 2012-16) even until 2025 in other

                    Almost every engineering system centers around the

            <h2>What should you already know?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You should already be familiar of some of the simple ways in
                which we can treat transport phenomena from your earlier
                courses.
              </li>
              <li>
                For conduction of heat, we use the integral form of Fourier's
                law. \begin{align*} Q &= U\,A\,\Delta T\end{align*}
              </li>
              <li>
                The problem with this expression is its only valid for very
                simple systems (like a flat wall).
              </li>
              <li>
                However, as its name suggests, it is the integrated form of
                <b> differential form of Fourier's law</b>. \begin{align*} q &=
                -k\frac{dT}{dx}\end{align*}
              </li>
              <li>
                We should be able to take the more general differential form and
                apply it to any heat transfer problem...
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We also need to approach heat transfer problems through Energy
                balances. \begin{align*} (Q_{in} - Q_{out})\Delta t &=
                m\,C_P\Delta T\end{align*}
              </li>
              <li>
                Again, this is just an integrated form of a
                <b> differential energy balance</b>: \begin{align*} q_{in} -
                q_{out} &= \rho\,C_P \frac{dT}{dt}\end{align*}
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Transport phenomena</b> is the study of using
                <i>differential</i> constitutive relationships (e.g., Fourier's
                law) and <i>differential</i> balances to generate engineering
                expressions for any system.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It's important to note that <b>transport phenomena</b> is more
                general than heat transfer.
              </li>
              <li>
                You should be familiar with the transport equations of basic
                fluid flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, Bernoulli's equation is an energy balance of a
                flow: \begin{align*}\frac{1}{2}\rho\,v^2 + p -
                \rho\,g\,h\end{align*} \begin{align*}E_{kinetic} + E_{pressure}
                + E_\text{grav. potential}\end{align*}
              </li>
              <li>
                And there is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for flow in a pipe,
                relating the volumetric flow-rate, $\dot{V}$, to the pressure
                drop, $\Delta p$. \begin{align*} \dot{V}_z= -\pi\frac{\Delta
                p}{L}\frac{R^4}{8\,\mu} \end{align*}
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Later in the course, we will show that Bernoulli's equation can
                be derived from a more general momentum balance equation:
                \begin{align*} \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{v}}{\partial t} &=
                -\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla \boldsymbol{v} +
                \rho^{-1}\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau} - \rho^{-1}\nabla p +
                \boldsymbol{g} \end{align*}
              </li>
              <li>
                If we then use a <i>constitutive relation</i> for momentum, such
                as Newton's law of viscosity: \begin{align*} \tau_{xy} = -\mu
                \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial y} \end{align*} we can then derive
                the Hagen-Poiseuille expression for flow in pipes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Again, we can combine a constitutive relationship (Newton's law
                of viscosity) with a differential balance (momentum balance) to
                solve flow problems using the study of
                <b>Transport Phenomena</b>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              Analytical results of <b> Transport Phenomena</b> are usually
              limited to simple geometries and problems:

            <p>
              As engineers, we'll use simple analytical results as design
              equations, and lean on numerics/CFD for more complex questions.

                Boiling liquids are an example of a complex heat transfer and
                multiphase flow problems:

                We will need <b> empirical expressions</b> to be able to perform
                engineering calculations on this system.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, the best empirical expressions are usually based
                somehow on the simpler analytical results.
              </li>
              <li>
                In this course we will look at both analytical results from
                Transport Phenomena, and empirical &ldquo;fudges&rdquo; for more
                complex systems.

              The transport phenomena book is not only legendary in uniting the
              study of all these fields, its written beautifully and even
              contains easter eggs. The first letter of each paragraph in the
              post-face spells "ON WISCONSIN" which is the school most dear to
              the authors. The first letter of each sentence in the preface
              spells "This Book Is Dedicated To O Hougen".</small
